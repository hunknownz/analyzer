# Analyzer3

Analyzer3 is an intelligent analysis system designed to evaluate and forecast the status and potential of Web3 projects. Leveraging on-chain data and project repository information, it provides comprehensive insights into a project’s ecosystem. With the use of data-driven metrics, Analyzer3 assesses the health and future outlook of a project, tracks contributors based on their actual impact, and facilitates decentralized reward distribution.

## Features

### 1. Automated Dependency Analysis

Analyzer3 scans open-source projects to visualize their dependencies, offering a clear map of how various components are interconnected. This feature helps sponsors understand the project’s reliance on other open-source tools and their influence on the ecosystem.

### 2. AI-Driven Repository Analysis

Analyzer3 integrates large language model (LLM)-powered AI to analyze project repositories, providing a deeper understanding of a project’s ecosystem. Each dependency project can be analyzed individually, allowing users to explore and understand every component that supports the primary project.

### 3. Project Ranking and Rating

Analyzer3 evaluates each project based on a set of key metrics and provides a ranking and rating system. This scoring system allows sponsors and developers to quickly assess a project’s overall quality, impact, and potential, making more informed decisions about their involvement and support.

### 4. Contributor Mapping

The platform identifies and evaluates contributors by measuring their engagement, contributions, and overall impact within the project. This enables sponsors to focus their support on specific contributors or teams who have made significant contributions to the project.

### 5. Data-Driven Sponsorship

Analyzer3 equips sponsors with actionable insights derived from detailed analysis, enabling them to make informed decisions on fund allocation. Sponsors can choose to support the entire project, reward specific contributors, or fund vital dependencies sustaining the project ecosystem.

### 6. Fair and Transparent Funding

By utilizing blockchain technology, Analyzer3 ensures that all sponsorship transactions are traceable and equitable. This guarantees that funds are distributed fairly and transparently, based on the actual contributions made by developers and contributors.

## How It Works

Analyzer3 provides an end-to-end solution for Web3 project analysis and contributor rewards. It uses a combination of automated data collection, AI-driven analysis, and blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent ecosystem for open-source contributions.

1. **Dependency Mapping**: The system scans and visualizes dependencies within the project’s repository.
2. **Contributor Evaluation**: Tracks contributions and evaluates the impact of individual contributors.
3. **Ranking and Rating**: Provides project scores based on key metrics to assist in decision-making.
4. **Data-Driven Sponsorship**: Enables sponsors to fund projects, contributors, or dependencies based on data insights.
5. **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensures all funding and transactions are traceable and fair.
